## Project Overview
The Superstore Dashboard is an Excel-based interactive visualization tool created using Power Query. It provides insights into sales, customer segments, and product performance over time. Designed for business analysts, managers, and stakeholders, this dashboard simplifies data-driven decision-making by highlighting key metrics and trends from the Superstore Dataset.

### Key Features:
- Total Sales, Customer Count, and Segment-wise Sales metrics.
- Interactive filtering by category and year.
- Customer segmentation analysis (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office).
- Monthly trends for Sales and Customer Count across product categories.
- Bar and pie charts to visualize sales performance and segment contributions.
- Drill-down capabilities for subcategories within product categories.

## Data Overview
This dataset contains sales transaction data, including details about customer orders, products, and shipping. It is structured to provide insights into various business dimensions such as **Order ID**, **Customer Information**, **Product Categories**, **Sales Performance**, and **Shipping Details**. The dataset includes key metrics like **Sales**, **Quantity**, **Profit**, and **Discount**, which can be used for **Business Intelligence (BI)** analysis to identify trends, optimize sales strategies, and improve inventory management. The data spans multiple years and covers a wide range of product categories, making it ideal for exploring customer behavior, sales performance, and profitability across different regions and segments.
